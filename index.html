              My partner was not able to file his tax returns for many years. We initially hired two tax lawyers, to deal with these issues. Neither of the tax lawyers did much, but they both charged us healthy fees and, the tax problem was not solved by them at all.
              One day we were introduced to Michael at FORTAX, by a friend whose taxes had been filed by FORTAX for years. Michael very confidently accepted our complicated case and in a very short period of time organized the mess of our many years of
              tax documents in a clear way. Meanwhile, he also frequently communicated with us to ensure we were paying CRA on time. Over time, our tax problem, which had gone unresolved for years (even unresolved by tax lawyers), was solved by FORTAX
              to our complete satisfaction. FORTAX has filed our tax returns for several years now and we are totally stress free. The following words are our description for Fortax: Professional, knowledgeable, trustworthy, efficient, diligent, honest
              and patient. When you seek accounting and tax services, or you have tax issues, don’t look for the big or fancy names of tax firms or tax lawyers, look for someone who cares the most for the customers.

              A friend of ours referred us to Michael because he knew that our financial situation was rather complicated. We had a small business and were quite stressed out. Michael was able to help us with sorting out our finances. We were also impressed by his patience and thoughtfulness, which was a big emotional support for us. We can strongly recommend his services to anybody who is looking for an honest, decent and thoughtful financial adviser.
